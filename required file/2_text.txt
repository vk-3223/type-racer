All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence,
while even the most complicated insect behaviour is never taken as an indication of intelligence.
What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female wasp returns to,
checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside.
The real nature of the wasp’s instinctual behaviour is revealed if the food is moved a
few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced.
Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of 
Sphex—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.
